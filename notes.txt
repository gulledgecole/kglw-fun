10pm, 8/6

Was sitting on G Train, days after seeing KGLW at forest hills, and had this idea. 

Could be fun due do some math and look at some similiarity measures betwen shows. KGLW.net has a plethora of data, prolly powered by the setlistfm.api. 

Could piggy bank and pull that down, and then search for archives wav files and begin to do some analysis. Such as similiarty setlists, applause after song, if any.? Overal loudness of venue.

Dunno, just gonna not going replicate what's on KGLW.net.

woah, no auth. Will try not to throttle.

Able to pull all setlist for a whole year. I think this may be the only thing we need. ** Edit, I may want to hit venue api.

From here, can at least build cat analysis and begin to pull .wav files to begin audio processing. I may have to scape the .wav files... 

of the fields reutnr by this API method, I think I only want the following: 

    uniqueId
    show_id
    showdate
    showtitle
    song_id
    song_name
    position
    tracktime
    transition_id , dunno what this is but could be cool.?
    transition
    venue_id. ---> This also has its own endpoint which may contain stats about venue size / outside / etc etc which may be needed for audio anlysis to eliminate bias.
    shownotes
    showyear
    showorder
    tour_id
    tourname
    venuename
    city
    state
    country
